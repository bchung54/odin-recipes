        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fairly modern Italian dessert paired down to its essentials. Ladyfingers covered in a creamy mixture of eggs and cream, all topped with cocoa.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ladyfinger biscuits</li>
            <li>Egg yolks</li>
            <li>Heavy cream</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>Coffee</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make coffee ahead of time and let cool. Take mascarpone out of the fridge ahead of time to let it loosen up.</li>
            <li>Place egg yolks and half the sugar into a mixing bowl. Whisk for about 5 minutes over a pot of simmering water.</li>
            <li>Add mascarpone into the beaten mixture and keep whisking until there are no more lumps of cheese.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form (about 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Fold the two mixtures together until well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Dip ladyfingers into the cold coffee for 1-2 seconds on each side. Layer them in the dish or tray that you will use to make the tiramisu.</li>
            <li>Cover the layer of ladyfingers with half of the egg and cream mixture. Spread evenly and add a thin layer of cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Repeat last two steps to add another layer of ladyfingers and cream.</li>
            <li>Cover with cling wrap and a lid. Place in fridge to let it firm up overnight.</li>
        </ol>
